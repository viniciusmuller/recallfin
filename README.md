RecallFin is a lightweight, privacy-focused tool that automatically indexes
content you consume so that you can search it later, acting as a
powerful extension for your memory.

# Features
- **Privacy-focused** - Everything is stored locally and never leaves your machine
- **Simple** - No fancy AI stuff, just OCR, SQLite and HTML.
- **Full-text search** - Allows you to perform a fast full-text search across all the content you've consumed
- **AFK Detection** - Detects when you barely scrolled or are AFK and saves disk space
